Practice example of Github

This repository was created as an example/practice with Github. 

Information was collected from https://datacarpentry.org/rr-version-control/02-git-in-github/index.html and 
https://researchdata.wisc.edu/news/version-control-for-research-projects/ (Git and Github section of article).

Github supports programming languages, and the README.md supports text editing programs such as HTML and Markdown. For instance, when editing this file, I wrote the next line in heading 1 in html:
<h1> This line is in HTML </h1>

Apparantly, though, markdown is easier. So, if you're interested, here is a link: https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github

Once done editing a file, make sure to commit your changes. Github thrives on the commit feature. Github is similar to the KB where it will keep track of all changes over time, and it will have you comment on why you changed something.

The following has been added by my other personal Github account (ziakoscik):
I edited this file by forking this repository to my account, and then editing the README file. Details on how to do this are under the collaborating section of the following article: https://datacarpentry.org/rr-version-control/02-git-in-github/index.html
